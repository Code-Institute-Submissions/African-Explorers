## **UX (User Experience)** 

### **Project Goals**

The goal of this project is to provide a clear & concise online presence to the fictional business 
African Explorers. African Explorers are a tour operator who specialise in guided safari 
tours in search of the famous big 5 (Lion, Elephant, Rhino, Leopard, Buffalo) in the authentic wilderness of the ..... national park in Southern Africa. 

With the busy modern lives of customers and a high amount of business competition in this area the site needs
to be simple to navigate with the information on the company & tours provided with as little mouse clicks and scrolling as possible.

## **Design Choices**

The average age of a buying customer for safari travel is 50 years old (actually a drop from 70 over the last 20 years) showing that it is a form of travel most popular with working middle aged professionals. https://bit.ly/2WEPB0P

This was very much on my mind when designing the site. People of this age are more likely to be busy with work, commutes, and family commitments meaning time is more precious.  Because of this I want the site to be of minlistic design, straight to the point and with key information easily findable with little searching. 
I didn't feel the need for alternative street style fonts & colours which would appeal to a younger audience for example. 

People of this age group are also likely to be on the move a lot due work & family travel commitments so I have a decided to go with a mobile first design with Bootstrap. 

### **Fonts**

Considering the likely age user group of the website I decided to us Roboto regular 400 as my font as it is "safe", very easy to read, and neutral. I did not think it would be right to go too creative in this case. An interesting article on safe web fonts - https://websitesetup.org/web-safe-fonts-html-css/

### **Icons**

Icons will be used alongside the text of navigation links to provide further usability. They will be taken from https://fontawesome.com/ and chosen to be self explanatory. 


### **Colours**

The colour scheme was chose on the basis that I wanted a simple, clean and visually appealing site that was emotive of colours associated with an African safari. 
![Colours](/assets/images/colours.png)

* For the navigation bar I will be using 41B45A Green Pantone which is a nice friendly colour and I thought green is the colour most associated with nature. 
* Background colour of site will be FAFAFA white to keep it clean and easy to contrast against.  
* When user scroll over navigation links the shade of green will change to 15795B a darker shade of green (Spanish Viridian) to show the highlight to the user which link they will be pressing. 
* For the testimonial and latest sighting sections of the site the background colour will be F2E7CF Champagne which will give the area a subtle highlight to draw attention and is a shade of brown/yellow found on the African plains.
* Text colour through the site will be black. This was chosen as it easy to read on all colours chosen.

## **Wireframes**

![Wireframes](/wireframes/desktop_wf/index.html.png)

To create my wireframes I uses a software called Balsamiq to create low fidelity frames of the site. 
I chose Balsamiq as it is user friendly and allows you to add graphical images which I find very helpful for visualising the site. For example the graphics
with the navigation links and the scrolling testimonials really allowed me to get an idea of how the site could look. 

I did find a slight issue with Balsamiq and that was when the desktop wireframes were exported the line under the navigation links was extended to look messy. It should be noted this is not an intentional design. 

As I am building this site to be responsive it was very important for me to produce wireframes of desktop, mobile, and tablet. Click on the links below to see in more detail.

## **Testing**

Further details on this section will be added but the initial testing plan will be to use the follow tools/methods:

* W3C HTML & CSS validation services to check for bugs in HTML/CSS
* Chrome DevTools and inspector to check to test the responsiveness of the site on different devices.
* A spreadsheet will also be created to test and document the navigation links and loading times on the following browsers
    * Safari
    * Chrome
    * Internet Explorer
    * Firefox 
* A site such as https://tools.pingdom.com/ will also be used to test the speed of the site. 
* Bootstap is also being used as it provides in built responsive on a mobile first approach and uses Flexbox instead of CSS grid which is compatible with more browser (new and old)

## **Design Choices**

The average age of a buying customer for safari travel is 50 years old (actually a drop from 70 over the last 20 years) showing that it is a form of travel most popular with working middle aged professionals. https://bit.ly/2WEPB0P

This was very much on my mind when desiging the site. People of this age are more likely to be busy with work, commutes, and family commitments meaning time is more precious.  Because of this I want the site to be of minilistic design, straight to the point and with key information easily findable with little searching. 
I didn't feel the need for alternative street style fonts & colours which would appeal to a younger auidence for example. 

People of this age group are also likely to be on the move a lot due work & family travel commitements so I have a decided to go with a mobile first design with Bootstrap. 

### **Fonts**

Considering the likely age user group of the website I decided to us Roboto regular 400 as my font as it is "safe", very easy to read, and neutral. I did not think it would be right to go too creative in this case. An interesting articale on safe web fonts - https://websitesetup.org/web-safe-fonts-html-css/

### **Icons**

Icons will be used alongside the text of navigation links to provide further useability. They will be taken from https://fontawesome.com/ and chosen to be self explantory. 


### **Colours**

The colour scheme was chose on the basis that I wanted a simple, clean and visually appealing site that was emotive of colours associated with an African safari. 
![Colours](/assets/colours.png)

* For the navigation bar I will be using 41B45A Green Pantone which is a nice friendly colour and I thought green is the colour most assoicated with nature. 
* Background colour of site will be FAFAFA white to keep it clean and easy to contrast against.  
* When user scroll over navigation links the shade of green will change to 15795B a darker shade of green (Spanish Viridian) to show the highlight to the user which link they will be prressing. 
* For the testimonal and latest sighting sections of the site the background colour will be F2E7CF Champagne which will give the area a subtle highlight to draw attention and is a shade of brown/yellow found on the African plains.
* Text colour throught the site will be black. This was chosen as it easy to read on all collours chosen.
